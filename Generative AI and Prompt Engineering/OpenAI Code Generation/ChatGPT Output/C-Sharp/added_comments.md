# C# Code Explanation with Comments

This document outlines a C# program that includes a function for counting occurrences of a specific character within a given string. The function utilizes LINQ for concise and efficient computation.

## C# Program

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    // Function to count occurrences of a character in a string
    static int CountChar(char character, string inputString)
    {
        // Using LINQ Count method with a lambda expression to count occurrences
        return inputString.Count(c => c == character);
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Example character and string
        char character = 'a';
        string inputString = "banana";

        // Call CountChar function to count occurrences of the character
        int charCount = CountChar(character, inputString);

        // Print the result
        Console.WriteLine($"The character '{character}' appears {charCount} times in the string '{inputString}'.");
    }
}
```

## Explanation of Comments

- The `CountChar` function is defined to efficiently count occurrences of a character within a given string. This is achieved by leveraging LINQ's `Count` method, combined with a lambda expression to specifically count the occurrences of the specified character.
- Inside the `Main` method, an example usage of the `CountChar` function is demonstrated with the character `'a'` and the string `"banana"`. This illustrates how the function is called and how the result of the occurrence count is output to the console.
