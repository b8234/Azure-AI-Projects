This Python script allows users to generate images based on textual prompts using OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model. It leverages the OpenAI API to create an image, which is then downloaded and saved locally.

## Features

- **Generate Images**: Create images from text prompts using OpenAI's advanced DALL-E 3 model.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for API requests and image saving.
- **Environment Variables**: Utilizes environment variables for API key management, enhancing security.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later.
- An OpenAI API key with access to the DALL-E 3 model.
- The `openai`, `requests`, and `Pillow` Python packages installed.
