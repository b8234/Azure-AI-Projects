# Text Analysis using Azure Language Services

## Description
This project is part of the Microsoft AI MS Learn series. It uses Azure Language Services to perform text analysis. The script processes text to detect language, analyze sentiment, extract key phrases, and identify entities and linked entities. 

## Objectives
- Demonstrate integration with Azure Language Services for real-world text analysis.
- Implement a solution architecture leveraging Azure's AI capabilities for language detection, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.
- Showcase problem-solving skills in cloud-based AI and machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- Azure AI Text Analytics for language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and entity recognition.
- Python for scripting and automation.
- Azure SDKs and APIs.

## Setup and Installation
To set up this project:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics python-dotenv
```

## Configuration
- Set up Azure Cognitive Services in the Azure portal.
- Create `.env` file with Azure service credentials:
  ```
  COG_SERVICE_KEY=your_key
  COG_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
  ```

## How to Use
Run the script with:
```
python script_name.py
```

## Architectural Insights
- The project is designed to efficiently process text data using Azure AI, ensuring scalability and security, key concerns in cloud architecture.
- The script design allows for easy adaptation and integration into larger cloud solutions.

## Example Output
- Example output is in folder []

## Learning Outcomes
